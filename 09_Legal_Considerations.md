## Legal Considerations
*Instructions*: This section is a summary only of any legal issues.  The summary in this section will include information regarding any identified legal issues – including privacy, Charter, Constitutional and administrative law, etc. If Legal Services has previously provided a legal opinion on the regulatory solution or a component of the regulatory solution, please include a summary of the assessment here (and append the opinion as an annex to the policy paper).

* After this policy statement is completed, Legal Services must be engaged to provide a formal legal opinion confirming that there is sufficient legislative authority to proceed with the proposed regulatory changes.  
* The opinion should:
  * Clearly assess the legal risks to the Agency of the problem going unaddressed;
  * Assess any legal risks associated with the proposed solution;
  * Identify legislative authority for the proposed solution.  If legislative authority does not exist, the opinion should identify what legislative changes are necessary prior to implementation;
  * Confirm that the correct sections of the regulation needing amendment have been identified within this paper; and
  * Identify whether the proposal has implications with respect to the Crown’s obligations under modern treaties.
