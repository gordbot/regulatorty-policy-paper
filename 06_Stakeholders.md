## Stakeholders
####### Note
> Consultation is a mandatory component in the regulatory process.  The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat requires that consultations be ongoing, far-reaching, and meaningful.  This means that you should be consulting at every stage of the regulatory process. Consultations on the specifics of the proposed regulatory amendments are required.  As such, it is highly recommended that a Consultation Strategy document be prepared that outlines all the method(s) that will be used to consult identified stakeholders.

### List all stakeholders that would be impacted by this proposal. Cast as wide a net as possible – this means including operational areas, regional offices, other government departments, and organizations representing stakeholders.

### Have stakeholder consultations taken place? [if so, list the month/year in which the consultation occurred]. Or describe when the consultations are planned to occur [month/year].

### Have potentially impacted Indigenous groups been consulted?  If so, describe when they occurred [month/year] or describe when these consultations are planned to occur [month/year].

### Could the proposal trigger the Crown’s duty to consult with Indigenous groups?


### Please include a brief explanation as to why each stakeholder is on the list – i.e. why do you think a particular stakeholder will care about your proposal?


### Identify the total number of each stakeholder group – i.e. rather than saying “Lawyers” determine the size of this stakeholder population.


### Break down the stakeholder population by business size (micro, small, large).
