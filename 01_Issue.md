## Issue
### What is the practical, real-life problem you are trying to solve?
*Instructions*: The issue statement should ideally be one sentence maximum, per problem.  Identifying the problem that needs to be solved is the most important part of the policy paper because it will dictate everything else that follows in the paper, including research and consultations needed. Consequently, take time to articulate the issue clearly, concisely, and precisely, describing the practical, real-life problem. Add issues, as needed.

#### Examples
##### Appropriately identified issues
1. In households with a female parent and a gender-neutral parent, female parents are unable to designate the gender-neutral parent as the eligible individual for receiving the Canada Child Benefit unlike all other household compositions.
1.  “The T183/T183CORP forms require a wet signature and stakeholders have requested that the CRA allow electronic signatures in order to facilitate compliance by electronic filers.”

##### Inappropriately worded issues
1. “Regulations are needed because the legislation cannot be implemented without them.”  This is the “issue” for many regulatory proposals.
1.  “Regulations are needed to address problems with the reporting requirements”. This “issue” is too vague.

### Why do the issue(s) you have identified create a problem?
*Instructions*: This description should be three to four sentences maximum.  If you feel the need to write more than three or four sentences here, then this information likely needs to be situated under the “Background” heading below.  These three or four sentences here serve as a brief summary of the more detailed information in the background that gave rise to the problem.
