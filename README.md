# Regulatory Policy Paper Template
## Policy paper markdown template for regulatory proposals.

Template to assist program areas in researching and documenting proposed policy changes and to support Regulatory Affairs in conducting required analyses, preparing regulatory documents as required by Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Directives, policies, and guidelines.

The regulatory policy paper is intended to be completed early in the regulatory development process to ensure that adequate analysis of policy and instrument options has been completed.

## How can you help?
This policy paper template has been built up over the years by analysts in various departments and has undergone updates to ensure compliance with new requirements. I made the decision to post this policy paper template onto GitHub so that it could be easily re-used by anyone and will hopefully be improved by adding the experience of other policy analysis.  I'm also interested in seeing the benefits of using GitHub for document versioning with the intention of generating a Microsoft Word document from the markdown pages.
