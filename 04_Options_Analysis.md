## OPTIONS ANALYSIS
*Instructions*: This section must clearly and concisely explain all of the options that were considered.  A rationale must be included for rejecting all of the non-recommended options. Alternative mechanisms for compliance and enforcement with respect to small businesses could be described here.

If the problem can be solved through a non-regulatory mechanism, then the non-regulatory option must be seriously considered as an alternative to regulating.  Rejection of any non-regulatory solutions must be explained thoroughly.

General examples of non-regulatory solutions are as follows:
* Economic instruments - user fees; loans & loan agreements; public expenditure;
* Self-regulation - This includes regimes operating within a legislative framework;
* Standards and voluntary compliance;
* Contracts;
* Information and education;
* Formalized partnerships;
* Operational modifications – Such as administration/enforcement changes to modify public behaviour or administrative forbearance of law enforcement to accommodate industry; and
* Policy interpretation/positions of existing authorities, such as through Ministerial policy directives.

Factors to consider in generating “PROS” and “CONS” are as follows: cost; time; effort; stakeholder support; economic, sociological and environmental impacts; and, national security.
