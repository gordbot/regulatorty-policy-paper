## Objective(s)
*Instructions*: Each objective statement should ideally be one sentence maximum, corresponding with each problem – see example below within this section for an illustration of where an objective to solve the problem can have multiple components but still be expressed in one sentence.  

Identifying the objective that will solve the problem is the second most important part of the policy paper because it also will dictate everything else that follows in the paper, including research and consultations needed; consequently, take time to articulate the objective clearly, concisely and precisely, describing the practical, real-life solution to the problem.  Each objective must correspond, and directly respond, to each problem identified above under the “Issue(s)” heading. Add additional objectives as necessary.


**Objective 1**:


**Objective 2**:



#### Examples
##### Appropriately identified objectives
1.  “The objective of this amendment is to allow a female parent to designate a gender neutral parent as the ‘eligible individual’ for the purpose of receiving the Canada Child Benefit.
1.  “To facilitate signing and submission of T183/T183CORP forms by allowing electronic signatures.”

##### Inappropriately worded objectives
1.  “The objective is to make regulations because the legislation requires them for implementation.”  This is the “objective” for every regulatory proposal; or
1.  The objective is to make regulations that address certain issues related to tax evasion”.  This “objective” is too vague.
