## Impact Analysis
###### Note
The costs and benefits described below must be identified and verified with stakeholders through the consultation process.

### Potential Impact of Regulation
*Instructions*: Describe the impacts of the proposed solution with respect to:

#### Health & Safety


#### Security


#### Environment
*Instructions*: A preliminary scan must be conducted to demonstrate whether there are any environmental impacts.  See the [Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals](https://www.canada.ca/en/impact-assessment-agency/programs/strategic-environmental-assessment/cabinet-directive-environmental-assessment-policy-plan-program-proposals.html) for information and complete the “Preliminary Scan” portion of the questionnaire.


#### Economic
*Instructions*: For example, describe whether a sector of, or industry in, the economy will be impacted in terms of business opportunities, growth, innovation, sustainability.


#### Social and Economic Well-Being of Canadians
##### Gender-based Analysis Plus
*Instructions*: Describe factors such as cost of living; prices; income; and employment opportunities.  A [Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+)](https://women-gender-equality.canada.ca/en/gender-based-analysis-plus/what-gender-based-analysis-plus.html) is required for all regulatory proposals. Regulatory Affairs can help you engage the relevant GBA+ centre of expertise to fully complete the analysis during regulatory development. Provide as much detail below as you can about potential impacts.
* Provide a description of the affected populations disproportionately impacted;
* Describe the results of public consultations with affected groups (such as women, men and gender-diverse people) – what concerns have been expressed?;
* Describe the impacts of the regulatory proposal on these groups; and
* Describe how the implementation plan deals with the impacts identified.)


#### Assessment of Modern Treaty Implications
*Instructions*: Provide any information related to potential impacts to Canada’s indigenous population by completing an Assessment of Modern Treaty Implications (AMTI). Please see the [Cabinet Directive on the Federal Approach to Modern Treaty Implementation](https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/eng/1436450503766/1544714947616) for more information about conducting and supporting your analysis.  Provide as much detail as you can about potential impacts.  Regulatory Affairs can assist you in engaging resources to assist in completing the analysis during regulatory development.

### Costs and Benefits
###### Note
>Regulatory Affairs will assist in reviewing, commenting on, and providing recommended revisions of, draft policy papers to ensure adequacy, acceptability and relevance of the evidence being relied upon in developing the policy underlying the proposal, generally, and specifically with respect to this section.

*Instructions*:
* Estimate costs and benefits in this section, per year over a ten year period [an average annual cost is expected];
* State assumptions used in determining costs and benefits
* Ensure that assumptions are plausible in terms of their:
  * Adequacy [i.e. Ideally, several pieces of evidence are used to support a conclusion; however, sound judgement must be employed because one piece of evidence may be sufficient to support the conclusion];
  * Acceptability [i.e. Truthfulness, such as relying upon reputable sources for information]; and,
  *	Relevance [i.e. If the assumptions are based on analogy, ensure that the program or program modification being developed is akin to a comparable program in another jurisdiction or an existing government program].  
* If there are no cost or benefits, an explanation must be provided here;
* This section is not a cost-benefit analysis; rather, this section is a preliminary, rough estimate of the costs and benefits of the proposal that can be done using “bullet points”.)

#### Medium and Large Business Stakeholders
###### Note
>For the costs and benefits to business stakeholders, the following definitions apply:
* **Medium and Large Business**: Defined as any business, including its affiliates, that has greater than 100 employees and between more than $5 million in annual gross revenues.
* **Administrative Burden Costs**: The direct increase in costs (in Canadian dollars) to business resulting from a regulatory change that increases administrative burden as assessed against the current situation or a “business-as-usual” scenario. These costs relate to the change in behaviour arising directly from the regulatory change itself. To determine the incremental increase in administrative burden costs, the proposed regulatory change must be assessed against existing requirements in guidance, policy, regulation or law, whether they are voluntary or mandatory. For example, if a regulatory change proposes to entrench in law a requirement to collect and retain information that was previously voluntary, the incremental increase would apply only to the percentage of businesses that are not already collecting and retaining the information.
* **Compliance Costs**: Up-front capital costs as well as ongoing maintenance and training costs that businesses face when complying with a regulation. These include signage or notifications (when in material form, such as a road sign), testing, training staff, purchasing new equipment or software, maintaining equipment and software, renting additional space, purchasing equipment to maintain records (such as secure filing cabinets), etc.

>For discussion of the costs and benefits to small business stakeholders, the following definitions apply:
* **Small Business**: Defined as any business, including its affiliates, that has fewer than 100 employees or between $30,000 and $5 million in annual gross revenues.  This definition is based on commonly used definitions for what is considered a “small” business in Canada.
